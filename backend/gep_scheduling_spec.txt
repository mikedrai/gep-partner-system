GEP Service Scheduling Workflow â€“ As-Is & Enhancement Plan
Current Workflow Summary
1. Contract Initiation GEP signs a contract with the client for Safety Engineer and/or Occupational Doctor and other Services. 
Contract durations:
	â€¢	Typically 1 year.
	â€¢	Shorter for hotels and construction projects (can be days or weeks or months)
2. Regulatory Hour Calculation â€“ We Calculate the Assigned Hours for the Client based n the following criteria. Calculation based on SEPE (Greek labor inspection authority) regulations. 
	â€¢	Criteria:
	â€¢	Number of installations.
	â€¢	Total number of employees per Client / Number of employees per installation
	â€¢	Type of installation.
	â€¢	Type of work.
	â€¢	Output: Total required assigned hours per installation for the specific period of service.
3. Partner Assignment - Partners (safety engineers/doctors) are assigned to installations.
	â€¢	Assignment based on:
	â€¢	Geographic proximity.
	â€¢	Available hours.
	â€¢	Cost efficiency.
	â€¢	Partner must accept the assignment.
4. Schedule Planning - Partner drafts a complete schedule covering the agreed period.
	â€¢	Constraints:
	â€¢	Exact match with assigned hours.
	â€¢	Visits usually 1-2 hours, spaced monthly or bimonthly.
	â€¢	Visits must not overlap (even by one minute).
	â€¢	Any other specific client request â€“ just to inform the partner
	â€¢	Client-specific conditions (working hours, weekends) must be observed.
5. Approval & Locking
	â€¢	Partner submits schedule for GEP review.
	â€¢	GEP locks and uploads the final version to SEPE.net.
	â€¢	Once locked, no edits allowed unless formally requested and approved.
6. Modifications
	â€¢	Partner submits a change request.
	â€¢	GEP reviews, approves, and:
	â€¢	Updates SEPE.net.
	â€¢	Informs the client of the change.
	â€¢	All actions must be traceable.
7. Renewals
	â€¢	On contract renewal:
	â€¢	Compare current vs.Â previous employee/installation data.
	â€¢	Recalculate hours.
	â€¢	Default: assign the same partner if criteria still match.

	â€¢	Form received from the client regarding installations and employees.  
	â€¢	Hours Calculated (SEPE-based) 
	â€¢	Finding availability (pre partner assignment) â€“ cost analysis
	â€¢	Proposal and Contract Signed 
	â€¢	Importing Client & Installation Data
	â€¢	Partner Assigned (Location, Cost, Availability) 
	â€¢	Partner Accepts 
	â€¢	AI-Suggested Schedule Drafted for the whole year (or service date range)
	â€¢	Final Schedule Confirmed by Partner 
	â€¢	GEP Approves & Locks Schedule 
	â€¢	Schedule Uploaded to SEPE.net & Client Informed 
	â€¢	Change Request Tracked if Needed

Specification Requirements 
Functional Capabilities
	â€¢	Calendar interface for partner portal
	â€¢	Recurring scheduling 
	â€¢	Automatic warning / deny of overlap â€“ the ability to be able to customize overlap setting per services would be very helpful
	â€¢	AI-Based Schedule Suggestion
	â€¢	Recommend visit plans per installation/partner using:
	â€¢	Partner location
	â€¢	Travel efficiency
	â€¢	Hour availability
	â€¢	Cost optimization
	â€¢	Client access rules
	â€¢	Cost Management Module
	â€¢	Budget and compare partner costs across installations.
	â€¢	Forecast costs.
	â€¢	Change Tracking & Auditing
	â€¢	Full audit trail of:
	â€¢	Schedule submissions
	â€¢	Modifications
	â€¢	GEP approvals
	â€¢	Client communications
	â€¢	Email Notification System
	â€¢	Alerts for:
	â€¢	Assignment
	â€¢	Approval
	â€¢	Schedule Lock
	â€¢	Change Confirmations
	â€¢	Partner Availability Dashboard
	â€¢	Track historical assignments and open capacity.
	â€¢	Filter by cost, location, availability etc.
	â€¢	Renewal Assistant
	â€¢	Recalculate hours upon contract renewal.
	â€¢	Compare current vs.Â previous conditions.
	â€¢	Reassign partner if feasible.
	â€¢	SEPE.net Export Interface
	â€¢	Export schedule in excel 

Limitations:
	â€¢	for each installation (project) one partner is assigned for the full duration (at very rare instances more than one). Changes can occur â€“ assigning a new partner. Etc. 
	â€¢	Partner Programs are scheduled in advance for the whole duration of the project. Duration of each visit might differ depending on partner availability or customer needs (usually 1 â€“ 2 hours per visit) 
	â€¢	Projects are renewed and usually the same partner is assigned
	â€¢	Partners can request a change in visit but must be approved by the client account manager and the client must be informed of the change.
